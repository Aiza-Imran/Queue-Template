This is a QUEUE class template. Template classes provide flexibility and reusability, a mechanism for generic programming. They allow to create a single class template that can be instantiated with different data types. 
Making a queue class template allows to instantiate queue of different data types including primitive and user-defined.
There is also a custom exception handling class to handle specific type of error, defined according to exception that can occur within queue class. User-defined exception classes provide meaningful error messages and aid in debugging. 
Queue is implemented in a Circular manner.
